I'm Shirin, a biologist turned bioinformatician turned data scientist. 

I'm especially interested in machine learning and data visualization. While I am using R most every day at work, I wanted to have an incentive to regularly explore other types of analyses and other types of data that I don't normally work with. I have also very often benefited from other people's published code in that it gave me ideas for my own work; and I hope that sharing my own analyses will inspire others as much as I often am by what can be be done with data.  It's amazing to me what can be learned from analyzing and visualizing data!

My tool of choice for data analysis so far has been R. I also organize the [MÃ¼nsteR R-users group on meetup.com](https://shiring.github.io/r_users_group/2017/05/20/muenster_r_user_group).

I love dancing and used to do competitive ballroom and latin dancing. Even though I don't have time for that anymore, I still enjoy teaching "social dances" once a week with the Hochschulsport (university sports courses).

I created the R package [exprAnalysis](https://github.com/ShirinG/exprAnalysis), designed to streamline my RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. It is available via Github. Instructions for installation and usage can be found [here](https://shiring.github.io/rna-seq/microarray/2016/09/28/exprAnalysis).

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets (all freely available). I will also host teaching materials for students to access in conjunction with R courses I am giving.
