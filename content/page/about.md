My name is [Dr. Shirin (Elsinghorst](https://bit.ly/m/shirin_elsinghorst), born Glander). I'm a biologist turned bioinformatician turned data scientist. During my PhD and Postdoc I worked with quantitative traits & Next Generation Sequencing data in the context of Plant Evolutionary Biology and Genetic Epidemiology of diseases. I then chose to leave academia and became a data scientist for the German IT company [codecentric](https://www.codecentric.de/standorte/muenster/muenster-team). In this capacity, I have been gaining experience in a range of fields and applications around Data Analysis and Applied AI. In order to gain insight into different types of data, I am using a wide variety of tools - from (Bayesian) statistics to machine learning models, neural nets, generative AI and many more. The topics Explainable & Responsible AI and Data Storytelling are particularly important to me in order to share the potential benefits of data and AI with experts on non-experts alike.

My preferred tool for data analysis has been R but I also work with Python. I am also very passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge, so I give workshops, talk at conferences or [meetups](https://youtu.be/81UqFUk5B9I), write blog posts and organize the [MünsteR R-users group on meetup.com](https://shiring.github.io/r_users_group/2017/05/20/muenster_r_user_group).

I teach a [Data Camp course on hyperparameter tuning with R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/hyperparameter-tuning-in-r) (**UPDATE:** Before you take this course please consider [the info about the sexual harrassment scandal surrounding DataCamp](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/2019/04/consider_data_camp)!) and I'm on the program committee of the [Minds Mastering Machines M3 conference](https://m3-konferenz.de/programmkomitee.php).

<br>

I am also mom of two precious boys, who are not leaving me much time to persue coding at the moment. ;-) In 2022 and 2023, I trained and certified as a [volunteer lactation consultant](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.app/page/stibe/).

<br>

I love dancing and used to do competitive ballroom and latin dancing. For 11 years, I have been giving lessons as well. Even though I don't have time for that anymore, I still enjoy "social dances".

<br>

I created the R package [exprAnalysis](https://github.com/ShirinG/exprAnalysis), designed to streamline my RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. It is available via Github. Instructions for installation and usage can be found [here](https://shiring.github.io/rna-seq/microarray/2016/09/28/exprAnalysis); however, the package is not being actively maintained any longer.

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets (all freely available). I will also host teaching materials for students to access in conjunction with R courses I am giving.

Because I have been getting more emails with questions and requests for help than I can answer, you can now [book 15-minute time-slots with me](/page/bookme/). I will offer one 15-minute-slot per day on a first-come-first-serve basis. These 15 minutes will be free of charge but any help you might require beyond that, will have to be billed (details to be discussed in person).
