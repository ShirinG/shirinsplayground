I’m Shirin, a biologist turned bioinformatician turned data scientist. During my PhD and Postdoc I worked with Next Generation Sequencing data to analyze diseases like arthritis. However, I then chose to become a data scientist for a German IT company, called codecentric. In this capacity, I have been working on many different projects, e.g. building fraud detection models, creating a chatbot, implementing predictive maintenance, and more. My tool of choice for data analysis so far has been R but I also work with Python. I am also very passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge, so I give workshops, talk at conferences or [meetups](https://youtu.be/81UqFUk5B9I), write blog posts and organize the the [MünsteR R-users group on meetup.com](https://shiring.github.io/r_users_group/2017/05/20/muenster_r_user_group).  ![](/img/Bewerbungsfoto_klein.jpg)

I also teach a [Data Camp course in hyperparameter tuning with R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/hyperparameter-tuning-in-r) and I'm on the program committee of the [Minds Mastering Machines M3 conference](https://m3-konferenz.de/programmkomitee.php).

I love dancing and used to do competitive ballroom and latin dancing. Even though I don't have time for that anymore, I still enjoy teaching "social dances" once a week with the Hochschulsport (university sports courses).

I created the R package [exprAnalysis](https://github.com/ShirinG/exprAnalysis), designed to streamline my RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. It is available via Github. Instructions for installation and usage can be found [here](https://shiring.github.io/rna-seq/microarray/2016/09/28/exprAnalysis).

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets (all freely available). I will also host teaching materials for students to access in conjunction with R courses I am giving.
