I’m Shirin (Elsinghorst, born Glander), a biologist turned bioinformatician turned data scientist. During my PhD and Postdoc I worked with Next Generation Sequencing data. However, I then chose to become a data scientist for a German IT company, called codecentric. In this capacity, I have been working on many different projects, e.g. building fraud detection models, creating a chatbot, implementing predictive maintenance, and more. My preferred tool for data analysis has been R but I also work with Python. I am also very passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge, so I give workshops, talk at conferences or [meetups](https://youtu.be/81UqFUk5B9I), write blog posts and organize the [MünsteR R-users group on meetup.com](https://shiring.github.io/r_users_group/2017/05/20/muenster_r_user_group).

![My journey to Data Science](https://shiring.github.io/netlify_images/my_story_wml3zm.png)

I teach a [Data Camp course on hyperparameter tuning with R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/hyperparameter-tuning-in-r) (**UPDATE:** Before you take this course please consider [the info about the sexual harrassment scandal surrounding DataCamp](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/2019/04/consider_data_camp)!) and I'm on the program committee of the [Minds Mastering Machines M3 conference](https://m3-konferenz.de/programmkomitee.php).

<br>

I am also mom of two precious boys, who are not leaving me much time to persue coding at the moment. ;-) In 2022, I have started my training to become a [certified volunteer lactation consultant](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.app/page/stibe/).

<br>

I love dancing and used to do competitive ballroom and latin dancing. Even though I don't have time for that anymore, I still enjoy teaching "social dances".

I created the R package [exprAnalysis](https://github.com/ShirinG/exprAnalysis), designed to streamline my RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. It is available via Github. Instructions for installation and usage can be found [here](https://shiring.github.io/rna-seq/microarray/2016/09/28/exprAnalysis); however, the package is not being actively maintained any longer.

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets (all freely available). I will also host teaching materials for students to access in conjunction with R courses I am giving.

Because I have been getting more emails with questions and requests for help than I can answer, you can now [book 15-minute time-slots with me](/page/bookme/). I will offer one 15-minute-slot per day on a first-come-first-serve basis. These 15 minutes will be free of charge but any help you might require beyond that, will have to be billed (details to be discussed in person).

**Please note that I will be on parental leave until September 2022!**
