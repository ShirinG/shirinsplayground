Because I have been getting too many emails with questions and requests for help than I can answer, you can now **book 15-minute time-slots** with me. I will offer one 15-minute-slot per day on a **first-come-first-serve** basis. These 15 minutes will be **free of charge** and we will meet via Zoom, Skype or Google Meet. During these 15 minutes we can discuss your problem or question. Any help you might require beyond that, will have to be billed (details to be discussed in person). Click the button below to schedule a time-slot:
