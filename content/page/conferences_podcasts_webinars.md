## Workshops I am giving

- [Data Camp course on Hyperparameter Tuning in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/hyperparameter-tuning-in-r)

**UPDATE:** Before you take this course please consider [the info about the sexual harassment scandal surrounding DataCamp](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/2019/04/consider_data_camp)!

> For many machine learning problems, simply running a model out-of-the-box and getting a prediction is not enough; you want the best model with the most accurate prediction. One way to perfect your model is with hyperparameter tuning, which means optimizing the settings for that specific model. In this course, you will work with the caret, mlr and h2o packages to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters in an efficient manner using grid search, random search, adaptive resampling and automatic machine learning (AutoML). Furthermore, you will work with different datasets and tune different supervised learning models, such as random forests, gradient boosting machines, support vector machines, and even neural nets. Get ready to tune!

- [Workshop on Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow in R](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/2017/11/deep_learning_keras_tensorflow/)

> I offer a workshop on deep learning with Keras and TensorFlow using R.
Date and place depend on who and how many people are interested, so please contact me either directly or via the workshop page: https://www.codecentric.de/schulung/deep-learning-mit-keras-und-tensorflow/ (the description is in German but I also offer to give the workshop in English).

<br>

- [Workshop: End-2-End vom Keras TensorFlow-Modell zur Produktion](https://www.codecentric.de/schulung/end-2-end-vom-keras-tensorflow-modell-zur-produktion/)

> Durch das stark wachsende Datenvolumen hat sich das Rollenverst√§ndnis von Data Scientists erweitert. Statt Machine-Learning-Modelle f√ºr einmalige Analysen zu erstellen,  wird h√§ufiger in konkreten Entwicklungsprojekten gearbeitet, in denen Prototypen in produktive Anwendungen √ºberf√ºhrt werden.
Keras ist eine High-Level-Schnittstelle, die ein schnelles, einfaches und flexibles Prototypisieren von Neuronalen Netzwerken mit TensorFlow erm√∂glicht. Zusammen mit Luigi lassen sich beliebig komplexe Datenverarbeitungs-Workflows in Python erstellen. Das f√ºhrt dazu, dass auch Nicht-Entwickler den End-2-End-Workflow des Keras-TensorFlow-Modells zur Produktionsreife leicht
implementieren k√∂nnen.

- Next date: [We will give this workshop at the M3 conference in Mannheim on May 14th](https://www.m3-konferenz.de/lecture.php?id=8533&source=0)

- **German only -** [RICHTIG GUT: DIE QUALIT√ÑT VON MODELLEN VERSTEHEN](https://www.slideshare.net/ShirinGlander/richtig-gut-die-qualitt-von-modellen-verstehen)

[Vortrag auf der M3 Online-Konferenz am 16.06.2020](https://online.m3-konferenz.de/lecture.php?id=12337&source=0)

Mit Machine Learning getroffene Entscheidungen sind inh√§rent schwierig ‚Äì wenn nicht gar unm√∂glich ‚Äì nachzuvollziehen. Ein scheinbar gutes Ergebnis mit Hilfe von maschinellen Lernverfahren ist oft schnell erzielt oder wird von anderen als bahnbrechend verkauft.
Die Komplexit√§t einiger der besten Modelle wie neuronaler Netze ist genau das, was sie so erfolgreich macht. Aber es macht sie gleichzeitig zu einer Black Box. Das kann problematisch sein, denn Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer oder Vorst√§nde werden weniger geneigt sein, einer Entscheidung zu vertrauen und nach ihr zu handeln, wenn sie sie nicht verstehen.
Shapley Values, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) und Anchors sind Ans√§tze, diese komplexen Modelle zumindest teilweise nachvollziehbar zu machen.
In diesem Vortrag erkl√§re ich, wie diese Ans√§tze funktionieren, und zeige Anwendungsbeispiele.

LERNZIELE
* Die Teilnehmer erhalten Einblick in M√∂glichkeit, die komplexe Modelle erkl√§rbar machen.
* Sie lernen, Datens√§tze kritisch zu hinterfragen und angemessen aufzuteilen.
* Und sie erfahren, unter welchen Bedingungen sie Entscheidungen durch Machine Learning vertrauen k√∂nnen.

> Deep Learning is one of the "hot" topics in the AI area ‚Äì a lot of hype, a lot of inflated expectation, but also quite some impressive success stories. As some AI experts already predict that Deep Learning will become "Software 2.0", it might be a good time to have a closer look at the topic. In this session I will try to give a comprehensive overview of Deep Learning. We will start with a bit of history and some theoretical foundations that we will use to create a little Deep Learning taxonomy. Then we will have a look at current and upcoming application areas: Where can we apply Deep Learning successfully and what does it differentiate from other approaches? Afterwards we will examine the ecosystem: Which tools and libraries are available? What are their strengths and weaknesses? And to complete the session, we will look into some practical code examples and the typical pitfalls of Deep Learning. After this session you will have a much better idea of the why, what and how of Deep Learning, including if and how you might want to apply it to your own work. https://jax.de/big-data-machine-learning/deep-learning-a-primer/

> Traditional machine learning workflows focus heavily on model training and optimization; the best model is usually chosen via performance measures like accuracy or error and we tend to assume that a model is good enough for deployment if it passes certain thresholds of these performance criteria. Why a model makes the predictions it makes, however, is generally neglected. But being able to understand and interpret such models can be immensely important for improving model quality, increasing trust and transparency and for reducing bias. Because complex machine learning models are essentially black boxes and too complicated to understand, we need to use approximations to get a better sense of how they work. One such approach is LIME, which stands for Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations and is a tool that helps understand and explain the decisions made by complex machine learning models.
Dr. Shirin Glander is Data Scientist at codecentric AG. She has received a PhD in Bioinformatics and applies methods of analysis and visualization from different areas - for instance, machine learning, classical statistics, text mining, etc. -to extract and leverage information from data.
