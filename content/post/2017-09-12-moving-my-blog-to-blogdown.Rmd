It's been a long time coming but I finally moved my blog from Jekyll/Bootstrap on Github pages to blogdown, Hugo and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)! Moreover, I also now have my own domain name [www.shirin-glander.de](www.shirin-glander.de). :-)

I followed the [blogdown ebook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to set up my blog. I chose Thibaud Leprêtre's [tranquilpeak theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/). It looks much more polished than my old blog.

My old blog will remain where it is, so that all the links that are out there will still work (and I don't have to go through the hassle of migrating all my posts to my new site). You find a link to my old site in the sidebar.

Just to test that everything works, I run the example code:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
