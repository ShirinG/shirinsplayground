<p>Today, I have given a webinar for the Applied Epidemiology Didactic of the University of Wisconsin - Madison titled “From Biology to Industry. A Blogger’s Journey to Data Science.”</p>
<p>I talked about how blogging about R and Data Science helped me become a Data Scientist. I also gave a short introduction to Machine Learning, Big Data and Neural Networks.</p>
