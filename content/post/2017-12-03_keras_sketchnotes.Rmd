Recently, I announced [my workshop on Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow](https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/2017/11/deep_learning_keras_tensorflow/).

The next dates for it are **January 18th and 19th** in Solingen, Germany.

You can register now by following this link:
https://www.codecentric.de/schulung/deep-learning-mit-keras-und-tensorflow

If any non-German-speaking people want to attend, I'm happy to give the course in English!

As a little bonus, I am also sharing my sketch notes from a Podcast I listened to when first getting into Keras:

- [Software Engineering Daily with Francois Chollet](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/01/29/deep-learning-and-keras-with-francois-chollet/)
