<p>Recently, I announced <a href="https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/2017/11/deep_learning_keras_tensorflow/">my workshop on Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow</a>.</p>
<p>The next dates for it are <strong>January 18th and 19th</strong> in Solingen, Germany.</p>
<p>You can register now by following this link: <a href="https://www.codecentric.de/schulung/deep-learning-mit-keras-und-tensorflow" class="uri">https://www.codecentric.de/schulung/deep-learning-mit-keras-und-tensorflow</a></p>
<p>If any non-German-speaking people want to attend, Iâ€™m happy to give the course in English!</p>
<p><a href="mailto:shirin.glander@codecentric.de">Contact me if you have further questions.</a></p>

<p>As a little bonus, I am also sharing my sketch notes from a Podcast I listened to when first getting into Keras:</p>
