The [plumber](www.rplumber.io) (Trestle Technology, LLC 2017) package for R makes it easy to expose existing R code as a webservice via an API.

As said, you can take an existing R script and make accessible with plumber by simply adding a few lines of comments. If you have worked with Roxygen before, e.g. when building a package, you will already be familiar with the core concepts. If not, here are the most important things to know:

- you define every input paramter that will go into your function
- you define the output

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plumber)
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
