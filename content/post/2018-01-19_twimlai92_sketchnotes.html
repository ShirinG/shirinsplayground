<p>These are my sketchnotes for Sam Charrington’s podcast <strong>This Week in Machine Learning and AI</strong> about Learning State Representations with Yael Niv: <a href="https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-92-learning-state-representations-yael-niv/" class="uri">https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-92-learning-state-representations-yael-niv/</a></p>

<p>You can listen to the podcast <a href="https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-92-learning-state-representations-yael-niv/">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this interview Yael and I explore the relationship between neuroscience and machine learning. In particular, we discusses the importance of state representations in human learning, some of her experimental results in this area, and how a better understanding of representation learning can lead to insights into machine learning problems such as reinforcement and transfer learning. Did I mention this was a nerd alert show? I really enjoyed this interview and I know you will too. Be sure to send over any thoughts or feedback via the show notes page. <a href="https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-92-learning-state-representations-yael-niv/" class="uri">https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-92-learning-state-representations-yael-niv/</a></p>
