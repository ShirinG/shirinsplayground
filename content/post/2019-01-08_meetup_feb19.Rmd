In our [next MünsteR R-user group meetup](http://meetu.ps/e/Gg5th/w54bW/f) on **Tuesday, February 5th, 2019**, titled **Don’t reinvent the wheel: making use of shiny extension packages.**, Suthira Owlarn will introduce the shiny package and show how she used it to build an interactive web app for her sequencing datasets.

You can RSVP here: [http://meetu.ps/e/Gg5th/w54bW/f](http://meetu.ps/e/Gg5th/w54bW/f)

> Shiny is a popular R package for building interactive web apps and dashboards – no web development knowledge required! It’s ease-of-use and extendability makes it great for quick user-friendly presentations of toy projects as well as production-ready data products in various industries.

> In our first 2019 meetup, Suthira Owlarn will briefly demo a prototype of BioDEV, a shiny app that addresses a common pain-point in dealing with biological (omics) data sets. It allows interactive and intuitive exploration of user-provided data sets, integration of external data and download of parameterized interactive reports. She will then talk about packages that extend shiny by providing a variety of user interfaces, more advanced user interactions or an application-testing framework. Finally, we will cover some useful tools that aren’t specific to shiny, including an easy way to turn shiny apps into self-contained desktop applications.

## About the speaker:

> Suthira Owlarn is a biologist at the Max Planck Institute in Münster. After finishing her PhD, she decided to learn a little R and immediately fell in love! Soon, she waved goodbye to the bench and is now having fun diving into the world of data analysis, exploring R packages and building shiny apps.
