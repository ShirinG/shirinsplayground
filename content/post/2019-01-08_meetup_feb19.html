<p>In our <a href="http://meetu.ps/e/Gg5th/w54bW/f">next MünsteR R-user group meetup</a> on <strong>Tuesday, February 5th, 2019</strong>, titled <strong>Don’t reinvent the wheel: making use of shiny extension packages.</strong>, Suthira Owlarn will introduce the shiny package and show how she used it to build an interactive web app for her sequencing datasets.</p>
<p>You can RSVP here: <a href="http://meetu.ps/e/Gg5th/w54bW/f" class="uri">http://meetu.ps/e/Gg5th/w54bW/f</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shiny is a popular R package for building interactive web apps and dashboards – no web development knowledge required! It’s ease-of-use and extendability makes it great for quick user-friendly presentations of toy projects as well as production-ready data products in various industries.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In our first 2019 meetup, Suthira Owlarn will briefly demo a prototype of BioDEV, a shiny app that addresses a common pain-point in dealing with biological (omics) data sets. It allows interactive and intuitive exploration of user-provided data sets, integration of external data and download of parameterized interactive reports. She will then talk about packages that extend shiny by providing a variety of user interfaces, more advanced user interactions or an application-testing framework. Finally, we will cover some useful tools that aren’t specific to shiny, including an easy way to turn shiny apps into self-contained desktop applications.</p>

<h2>About the speaker:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Suthira Owlarn is a biologist at the Max Planck Institute in Münster. After finishing her PhD, she decided to learn a little R and immediately fell in love! Soon, she waved goodbye to the bench and is now having fun diving into the world of data analysis, exploring R packages and building shiny apps.</p>
