<p>I have been working with Keras for a while now, and I’ve also been writing quite a few <a href="https://shirinsplayground.netlify.app//tags/keras/">blogposts about it</a>; the most recent one being <a href="https://shirinsplayground.netlify.app/2020/09/keras_fruits_update/">an update to image classification using TF 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>However, in my blogposts I have always been using <strong>Keras sequential models</strong> and never shown how to use the <a href="https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/Functional_api.html"><strong>Functional API</strong></a>. The reason is that the Functional API is usually applied when building more complex models, like multi-input or multi-output models. And in my blogposts I usually show simple examples that don’t take too much time and computing power to run, so that everybody can follow along.</p>
<p>But the <a href="https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/Functional_api.html"><strong>Functional API</strong></a> can also be used to build simple models (in fact, every model built with the sequential API can also be built with the Functional API but <em>not vice versa</em>). Let me show you how it works! :-)</p>

<p><strong>Workshop announcement:</strong> Because this year’s UseR 2020 in Munich couldn’t happen as an in-person event, I will be giving my <a href="https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/">workshop on Deep Learning with Keras and TensorFlow</a> as an online event. I’ll be announcing the date once it’s been finalized but if you are interested in participating: we are looking at the first week of October (13:00 UTC).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<p>I have been having an <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/473">issue</a> with <code>blogdown</code>, where the code below runs perfectly fine in my R console from within the RMarkdown file but whenever I include any function from the <code>keras</code> package, <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> throws an error: <code>Error in render_page(f) : Failed to render 'content/post/keras.Rmd'</code>.</p>
<p>Since I have no idea what’s going on there (<code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> builds my site without trouble as long as I don’t include <code>keras</code> functions) and haven’t gotten a reply to the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/473">issue</a> I posted to Github, I had to write this blogpost without actually running the code while building the site.</p>
<p>I worked around that problem by not evaluating most of the code below and instead ran the code locally on my computer. Objects and images, I then saved as <em>.RData</em> or <em>.png</em> files and manually put them back into the document. By just reading this blogpost as it rendered on my site, you won’t notice much of a difference (except where I copy/pasted the output as comments below the code) but in order to be fully transparent, you can see on <a href="https://github.com/ShirinG/shirinsplayground/blob/master/content/post/2020-09-13_keras_fruits_update.Rmd">Github</a> what I did with hidden code chunks to create this post.</p>

<h2>Sequential models</h2>
<p>For many models, <code>keras_model_sequential</code> is sufficient! Whenever your model has one input (i.e. one set of images, one matrix, one set of texts, etc.), one output layer and a linear order of layers in between, you can use the <code>keras_model_sequential()</code> function. For example, it can be used to build simple <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/keras/blob/master/vignettes/examples/mnist_mlp.R">MLPs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/keras/blob/master/vignettes/examples/cifar10_cnn.R">CNNs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/keras/blob/master/vignettes/examples/imdb_bidirectional_lstm.R">(Bidirectional) LSTMs</a>.</p>

<div id="complex-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Complex models</h2>
<p>So, when would you use the <strong>Functional API</strong>? You can’t use the <code>keras_model_sequential</code> when you want to build a more complex model, e.g. in case you have multiple (types of) inputs (like matrix, images and text) or multiple outputs, or even complex connections between layers that can’t be described in a linear fashion (like directed acyclic graphs). Examples include an <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/keras/blob/master/vignettes/examples/mnist_acgan.R">Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/keras/blob/master/vignettes/examples/eager_styletransfer.R">neural style transfer</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-use-the-functional-api" class="section level2">
<h2>How to use the Functional API</h2>
<p>In the Functional API, you build your input and output layers and then pass them to the keras_model function. This model can be trained just like Keras sequential models.</p>
<p>The only part that may seem a bit magical at this point is passing only an input tensor and an output tensor to the keras_model function. Behind the scenes, Keras retrieves every layer involved in going from input_tensor to output_tensor, bringing them together into a graph-like data structure—a model. Of course, the reason it works is that output_tensor was obtained by repeatedly transforming input_tensor. If you tried to build a model from inputs and outputs that weren’t related, you’d get an error:</p>
<p>This error tells you, in essence, that Keras couldn’t reach input_1 from the provided output tensor.</p>
<p>When it comes to compiling, training, or evaluating a model built this way, the API is the same as that of sequential models:</p>
<p>The Functional API can be used to build models that have multiple inputs. Typically, such models at some point merge their different input branches using a layer that can combine several tensors: by adding them, concatenating them, and so on. This is usually done via a Keras merge operation such as layer_add, layer_concatenate, and so on. Let’s look at a very simple example of a multi-input model: a question-answering model.</p>
<p>A typical question-answering model has two inputs: a natural-language question and a text snippet (such as a news article) providing information to be used for answering the question. The model must then produce an answer: in the simplest possible setup, this is a one-word answer obtained via a softmax over some predefined vocabulary (see figure 7.6).</p>
<p>In the same way, you can use the Functional API to build models with multiple outputs (or multiple heads). A simple example is a network that attempts to simultaneously predict different properties of the data, such as a network that takes as input a series of social media posts from a single anonymous person and tries to predict attributes of that person, such as age, gender, and income level (see figure 7.7).</p>
<p>With the Functional API, not only can you build models with multiple inputs and multiple outputs, but you can also implement networks with a complex internal topology. Neural networks in Keras are allowed to be arbitrary directed acyclic graphs of layers. The qualifier acyclic is important: these graphs can’t have cycles. It’s impossible for a tensor x to become the input of one of the layers that generated x. The only processing loops that are allowed (that is, recurrent connections) are those internal to recurrent layers.</p>
<p>Several common neural-network components are implemented as graphs. Two notable ones are Inception modules and residual connections. To better understand how the Functional API can be used to build graphs of layers, let’s take a look at how you can implement both of them in Keras.</p>
<p>Inception modules
Inception[3] is a popular type of network architecture for convolutional neural networks; it was developed by Christian Szegedy and his colleagues at Google in 2013–2014, inspired by the earlier network-in-network architecture.[4] It consists of a stack of modules that themselves look like small independent networks, split into several parallel branches. The most basic form of an Inception module has three to four branches starting with a 1 × 1 convolution, followed by a 3 × 3 convolution, and ending with the concatenation of the resulting features. This setup helps the network separately learn spatial features and channel-wise features, which is more efficient than learning them jointly. More-complex versions of an Inception module are also possible, typically involving pooling operations, different spatial convolution sizes (for example, 5 × 5 instead of 3 × 3 on some branches), and branches without a spatial convolution (only a 1 × 1 convolution). An example of such a module, taken from Inception V3, is shown in figure 7.8.</p>
