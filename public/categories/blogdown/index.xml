      <description>It’s been a long time coming but I finally moved my blog from Jekyll/Bootstrap on Github pages to blogdown, Hugo and Netlify! Moreover, I also now have my own domain name www.shirin-glander.de. :-)
I followed the blogdown ebook to set up my blog. I chose Thibaud Leprêtre’s tranquilpeak theme. It looks much more polished than my old blog.
My old blog will remain where it is, so that all the links that are out there will still work (and I don’t have to go through the hassle of migrating all my posts to my new site).</description>
