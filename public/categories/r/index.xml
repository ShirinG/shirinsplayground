This is code that accompanies a book chapter on customer churn that I have written for the German dpunkt Verlag. The book is in German, however.
The code you find below can be used to recreate all figures and analyses from this book chapter. Because the content is exclusively for the book, my descriptions around the code had to be minimal.</description>

      <title>Whose dream is this? When and how to use the Keras Functional API</title>
      <link>https://shirinsplayground.netlify.app/2020/09/keras_funct_api/</link>

      <guid>https://shirinsplayground.netlify.app/2020/09/keras_funct_api/</guid>
      <description>I have been working with Keras for a while now, and I’ve also been writing quite a few blogposts about it; the most recent one being an update to image classification using TF 2.0.
However, in my blogposts I have always been using Keras sequential models and never shown how to use the Functional API. The reason is that the Functional API is usually applied when building more complex models, like multi-input or multi-output models.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have been getting a few comments on my old article on image classification with Keras, saying that they are getting errors with the code. And I have also gotten a few questions about how to use a Keras model to predict on new images (of different size). Instead of replying to them all individually, I decided to write this updated version using recent Keras and TensorFlow versions (all package versions and system information can be found at the bottom of this article, as usual).</description>

      <description>Alright, this is it: I am officially back! :-D
I have not written any blogposts for over a year. Last year, I had the cutest baby boy and ever since then, I did not get around to doing much coding. One of the reasons was that, unfortunately, we did not have the easiest of starts with the little one. Feeding problems led to weight gain problems, so we had to weigh him regularly.</description>

 Beyond Spreadsheets with R shows you how to take raw data and transform it for use in computations, tables, graphs, and more. You’ll build on simple programming techniques like loops and conditionals to create your own custom functions. You’ll come away with a toolkit of strategies for analyzing and visualizing data of all sorts using R and RStudio.</description>

      <guid>https://shirinsplayground.netlify.app/2019/01/text_classification_keras_data_prep/</guid>
      <description>In the past, I have written and taught quite a bit about image classification with Keras (e.g. here). Text classification isn’t too different in terms of using the Keras principles to train a sequential or function model. You can even use Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) for text classification.
What is very different, however, is how to prepare raw text data for modeling. When you look at the IMDB example from the Deep Learning with R Book, you get a great explanation of how to train the model.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I wrote two blogposts about image classification with Keras and about how to use your own models or pretrained models for predictions and using LIME to explain to predictions.
Recently, I came across this blogpost on using Keras to extract learned features from models and use those to cluster images. It is written in Python, though - so I adapted the code to R. You find the results below.</description>

      <description>After posting my short blog post about Text-to-speech with R, I got two very useful tips. One was to use the googleLanguageR package, which uses the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.
And indeed, it was very easy to use and the resulting audio sounded much better than what I tried before!
Here’s a short example of how to use the package for TTS:
Set up Google Cloud and authentification You first need to set up a Google Cloud Account and provide credit card information (the first year is free to use, though).</description>

      <description>Computers started talking to us! They do this with so called Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. With neural nets, deep learning and lots of training data, these systems have gotten a whole lot better in recent years. In some cases, they are so good that you can’t distinguish between human and machine voice.
In one of our recent codecentric.AI videos, we compared different Text-to-Speech systems (the video is in German, though - but the text snippets and their voice recordings we show in the video are a mix of German and English).</description>

      <description>Last week I published a blog post about how easy it is to train image classification models with Keras.
What I did not show in that post was how to use the model for making predictions. This, I will do here. But predictions alone are boring, so I’m adding explanations for the predictions using the lime package.
I have already written a few blog posts (here, here and here) about LIME and have given talks (here and here) about it, too.</description>

      <description>I’ve been using keras and TensorFlow for a while now - and love its simplicity and straight-forward way to modeling. As part of the latest update to my Workshop about deep learning with R and keras I’ve added a new example analysis:
Building an image classifier to differentiate different types of fruits
And I was (again) suprised how fast and easy it was to build the model; it took not even half an hour and only around 100 lines of code (counting only the main code; for this post I added comments and line breaks to make it easier to read)!</description>

 pkgnet is an R library designed for the analysis of R libraries! The goal of the package is to build a graph representation of a package and its dependencies.
 And I thought it would be fun to play around with it. The little analysis I ended up doing was to compare dependencies of popular machine learning packages.</description>

 Traditional machine learning workflows focus heavily on model training and optimization; the best model is usually chosen via performance measures like accuracy or error and we tend to assume that a model is good enough for deployment if it passes certain thresholds of these performance criteria.</description>

      <description>In a recent project, I was looking to plot data from different variables along the same time axis. The difficulty was, that some of these variables I wanted to have as point plots, while others I wanted as box-plots.
Because I work with the tidyverse, I wanted to produce these plots with ggplot2. Faceting was the obvious first step but it took me quite a while to figure out how to best combine facets with point plots (where I have one value per time point) with and box-plots (where I have multiple values per time point).</description>

      <description>I have written the following post about Predictive Maintenance and flexdashboard at my company codecentric’s blog:
 Predictive Maintenance is an increasingly popular strategy associated with Industry 4.0; it uses advanced analytics and machine learning to optimize machine costs and output (see Google Trends plot below). A common use-case for Predictive Maintenance is to proactively monitor machines, so as to predict when a check-up is needed to reduce failure and maximize performance.</description>

      <title>Why I use R for Data Science - An Ode to R</title>

      <description>Working in Data Science, I often feel like I have to justify using R over Python. And while I do use Python for running scripts in production, I am much more comfortable with the R environment. Basically, whenever I can, I use R for prototyping, testing, visualizing and teaching. But because personal gut-feeling preference isn’t a very good reason to give to (scientifically minded) people, I’ve thought a lot about the pros and cons of using R.</description>
