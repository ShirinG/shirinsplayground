      <description>A few colleagues of mine and I from codecentric.ai are currently working on developing a free online course about machine learning and deep learning. As part of this course, I am developing a series of videos about machine learning basics - the first video in this series was about Random Forests.
You can find the video on YouTube but as of now, it is only available in German. Same goes for the slides, which are also currently German only.</description>
