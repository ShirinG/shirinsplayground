      <description> On November 7th, Uwe Friedrichsen and I gave our talk from the JAX conference 2018: Deep Learning - a Primer again at the W-JAX in Munich.
A few weeks before, I gave a similar talk at two events about Demystifying Big Data and Deep Learning (and how to get started).
Here are the two very similar presentations from these talks:

      <description>Here I am sharing the slides for a webinar I gave for SAP about Explaining Keras Image Classification Models with LIME.

 Keras is a high-level open-source deep learning framework that by default works on top of TensorFlow. Keras is minimalistic, efficient and highly flexible because it works with a modular layer system to define, compile and fit neural networks. It has been written in Python but can also be used from within R.</description>
