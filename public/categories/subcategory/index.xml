      <description>Welcome to my page!
{:style=&amp;ldquo;float: left;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; margin-left: 7px; width: 200px&amp;rdquo;}
I&amp;rsquo;m Shirin, a biologist turned bioinformatician turned data scientist.
I&amp;rsquo;m especially interested in machine learning and data visualization. While I am using R most every day at work, I wanted to have an incentive to regularly explore other types of analyses and other types of data that I don&amp;rsquo;t normally work with. I have also very often benefited from other people&amp;rsquo;s published code in that it gave me ideas for my own work; and I hope that sharing my own analyses will inspire others as much as I often am by what can be be done with data.</description>
