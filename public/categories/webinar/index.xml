 Keras is a high-level open-source deep learning framework that by default works on top of TensorFlow. Keras is minimalistic, efficient and highly flexible because it works with a modular layer system to define, compile and fit neural networks. It has been written in Python but can also be used from within R.</description>

      <description>Today, I have given a webinar for the Applied Epidemiology Didactic of the University of Wisconsin - Madison titled “From Biology to Industry. A Blogger’s Journey to Data Science.”
I talked about how blogging about R and Data Science helped me become a Data Scientist. I also gave a short introduction to Machine Learning, Big Data and Neural Networks.
