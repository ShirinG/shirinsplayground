      <description>Because I have been getting too many emails with questions and requests for help than I can answer, you can now book 15-minute time-slots with me. I will offer one 15-minute-slot per day on a first-come-first-serve basis. These 15 minutes will be free of charge and we will meet via Zoom, Skype or Google Meet. During these 15 minutes we can discuss your problem or question. Any help you might require beyond that, will have to be billed (details to be discussed in person).</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m Shirin (Elsinghorst, born Glander), a biologist turned bioinformatician turned data scientist. During my PhD and Postdoc I worked with Next Generation Sequencing data. However, I then chose to become a data scientist for a German IT company, called codecentric. In this capacity, I have been working on many different projects, e.g. building fraud detection models, creating a chatbot, implementing predictive maintenance, and more. My preferred tool for data analysis has been R but I also work with Python.</description>
