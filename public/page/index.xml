      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Shirin, a biologist turned bioinformatician turned data scientist.
I&amp;rsquo;m especially interested in machine learning and data visualization. While I am using R most every day at work, I wanted to have an incentive to regularly explore other types of analyses and other types of data that I don&amp;rsquo;t normally work with. I have also very often benefited from other people&amp;rsquo;s published code in that it gave me ideas for my own work; and I hope that sharing my own analyses will inspire others as much as I often am by what can be be done with data.</description>
