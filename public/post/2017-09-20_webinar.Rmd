Today, I have given a webinar for the Applied Epidemiology Didactic of the University of Wisconsin - Madison titled "From Biology to Industry. A Blogger’s Journey to Data Science."

I talked about how blogging about R and Data Science helped me become a Data Scientist. I also gave a short introduction to Machine Learning, Big Data and Neural Networks.
