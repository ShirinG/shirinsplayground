In a recent project, I was looking to plot data from different variables along the same time axis. The difficulty was, that some of these variables I wanted to have as point plots, while others I wanted as box-plots.

Because I work with the tidyverse, I wanted to produce these plots with ggplot2. Faceting was the obvious first step but it took me quite a while to figure out how to best combine facets with point plots (where I have one value per time point) with and box-plots (where I have multiple values per time point).

The reason why this isn't trivial is that box plots require groups or factors on the x-axis, while points can be plotted over a continuous range of x-values. If your alarm bells are ringing right now, you are absolutely right: before you try to combine plots with different x-axis properties, you should think long and hard whether this is an accurate representation of the data and if its a good idea to do so! Here, I had multiple values per time point for one variable and I wanted to make the median + variation explicitly clear, while also showing the continuous changes of other variables over the same range of time.

So, I am writing this short tutorial here in hopes that it saves the next person trying to do something similar from spending an entire morning on stackoverflow. ;-)

For this demonstration, I am creating some fake data:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dates <- seq(as.POSIXct("2017-10-01 07:00"), as.POSIXct("2017-10-01 10:30"), by = 180) # 180 seconds == 3 minutes
fake_data <- data.frame(time = dates,
                        var1_1 = runif(length(dates)),
                        var1_2 = runif(length(dates)),
                        var1_3 = runif(length(dates)),
                        var2 = runif(length(dates))) %>%
  sample_frac(size = 0.33)
head(fake_data)
```

Here, variable 1 (`var1`) has three measurements per time point, while variable 2 (`var2`) has one.

First, for plotting with ggplot2 we want our data in a tidy long format. I also add another column for faceting that groups the variables from `var1` together.

```{r}
fake_data_long <- fake_data %>%
  gather(x, y, var1_1:var2) %>%
  mutate(facet = ifelse(x %in% c("var1_1", "var1_2", "var1_3"), "var1", x))
head(fake_data_long)
```

Now, we can plot this the following way:

- facet by variable
- subset data to facets for point plots and give aesthetics in `geom_point()`
- subset data to facets for box plots and give aesthetics in `geom_boxplot()`. Here we also need to set the `group` aesthetic; if we don't specifically give that, we will get a plot with one big box, instead of a box for every time point.

```{r}
fake_data_long %>%
  ggplot() +
    facet_grid(facet ~ ., scales = "free") +
    geom_point(data = subset(fake_data_long, facet == "var2"), 
               aes(x = time, y = y),
               size = 1) +
    geom_line(data = subset(fake_data_long, facet == "var2"), 
               aes(x = time, y = y)) +
    geom_boxplot(data = subset(fake_data_long, facet == "var1"), 
               aes(x = time, y = y, group = time))
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
fake_data_long <- mutate(fake_data_long, 
                         time_rounded = format(xts::align.time(time, n = 60*30), "%H:%M")) # round to 30 minutes
```

```{r plot, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
fake_data_long %>%
  ggplot() +
    facet_grid(facet ~ ., scales = "free") +
    geom_point(data = subset(fake_data_long, facet == "var2"), 
               aes(x = time, y = y),
               size = 1) +
    geom_line(data = subset(fake_data_long, facet == "var2"), 
               aes(x = time, y = y)) +
    geom_boxplot(data = subset(fake_data_long, facet == "var1"), 
               aes(x = time, y = y, group = time_rounded))
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
