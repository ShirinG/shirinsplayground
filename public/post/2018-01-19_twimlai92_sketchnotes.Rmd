These are my sketchnotes for Sam Charrington's podcast **This Week in Machine Learning and AI** about Learning State Representations with Yael Niv: https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-92-learning-state-representations-yael-niv/

![Sketchnotes from TWiMLAI talk #92: Learning State Representations with Yael Niv](https://shiring.github.io/netlify_images/twimlai92.jpg)

You can listen to the podcast [here](https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-92-learning-state-representations-yael-niv/).

> In this interview Yael and I explore the relationship between neuroscience and machine learning. In particular, we discusses the importance of state representations in human learning, some of her experimental results in this area, and how a better understanding of representation learning can lead to insights into machine learning problems such as reinforcement and transfer learning. Did I mention this was a nerd alert show? I really enjoyed this interview and I know you will too. Be sure to send over any thoughts or feedback via the show notes page. https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-92-learning-state-representations-yael-niv/
