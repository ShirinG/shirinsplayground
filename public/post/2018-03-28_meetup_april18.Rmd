In our [next M端nsteR R-user group meetup](http://meetu.ps/e/DVFrp/w54bW/f) on **Tuesday, April 17th, 2018** Kai Lichtenberg will talk about deep learning with Keras.
You can RSVP here: [http://meetu.ps/e/DDY1B/w54bW/f](http://meetu.ps/e/DDY1B/w54bW/f)

> Although neural networks have been around for quite a while now, deep
learning really just took of a few years ago. It pretty much all started
when Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton utterly crushed classic image
recognition in the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition
Challenge by implementing a deep neural network with CUDA on graphics
cards. A lot has changed since that time: The toolchain to do deep
learning has rapidly evolved into API's with a very high level of
abstraction. Nowadays everyone can train complex neural networks with
billions of free parameters. Just last year RStudio announced the Keras
for R package. Keras is a high level neural network API that makes it
really easy to define the architecture of a neural network. In this talk
we will rush through an explanation of convolutional neural networks for
image recognition, learn how easy it has become to do production ready
deep learning with the use of docker and why R's syntax is even better
suited to define a neural network than python's. (Hint: Probably this is
not a pipe ;-)

Kai Lichtenberg is a PhD student in the Bosch PhD Program working on
models to predict the reliability of components in drive trains by
leveraging the ever more available high dimensional data in the era of
the Internet of Things. Coming from the field of mechanical engineering
and technical reliability (which has a lot to do with stochastic
processes) he found his destination in data science. As a long time
computer enthusiast he is always keen to use the newest technologies. To
bear the pain of getting a toolchain up and running is probably his
super power.
