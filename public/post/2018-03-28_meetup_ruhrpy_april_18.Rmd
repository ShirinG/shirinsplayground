I'll be talking about Deep Learning with Keras in R and Python at the following two upcoming meetups:

- [Ruhr.Py 2018](https://www.meetup.com/Ruhr-py/events/248093628/) on Wednesday, April 4th

> Introducing Deep Learning with Keras and Python
Keras is a high-level API written in Python for building and prototyping neural networks. It can be used on top of TensorFlow, Theano or CNTK. In this talk we build, train and visualize a Model using Python and Keras - all interactive with Jupyter Notebooks!
