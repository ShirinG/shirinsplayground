**Update:** There is now a recording of the meetup up on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/jTFACgdhpi4).

Here you find my slides the [TWiML & AI EMEA Meetup about **Trust in ML models**](https://twimlai.com/meetup/), where I presented the [Anchors paper by Carlos Guestrin et al.](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf).

I have also just written two articles for the German IT magazin **iX** about the same topic of **Explaining Black-Box Machine Learning Models**:

- [A short article in the **iX 12/2018**](https://shop.heise.de/katalog/ix-12-2018)

- [The full article in **iX Developer Machine Learning**](https://shop.heise.de/katalog/blick-in-die-blackbox)
