When looking through the CRAN list of packages, I stumbled upon [this little gem](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pkgnet/vignettes/pkgnet-intro.html):

> pkgnet is an R library designed for the analysis of R libraries! The goal of the package is to build a graph representation of a package and its dependencies.

And I thought it would be fun to play around with it. The little analysis I ended up doing was to compare dependencies of popular machine learning packages.

**Update:** An alternative package to use would be [`cranly`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cranly/vignettes/cranly.html).

- I first loaded the packages:

```{r}
library(pkgnet)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
```

- I then created a function that will 

1. create the package report with `pkgnet::CreatePackageReport`
2. convert the edge (`report$DependencyReporter$edges`) and node (`report$DependencyReporter$nodes`) data into a graph object with `tidygraph::as_tbl_graph`

```{r}
create_pkg_graph <- function(package_name, DependencyReporter = TRUE) {
  
  report <- CreatePackageReport(pkg_name = package_name)
  
  if (DependencyReporter) {
    graph <- as_tbl_graph(report$DependencyReporter$edges,
                      directed = TRUE,
                      nodes = as.data.frame(report$DependencyReporter$nodes))
  } else {
    graph <- as_tbl_graph(report$FunctionReporter$edges,
                      directed = TRUE,
                      nodes = as.data.frame(report$FunctionReporter$nodes))
  }
  
  return(graph)
}
```

- To create a vector of machine learning packages from R I looked at [CRAN's machine learning task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html)

- These are the packages I ended up including:

```{r}
pkg_list <- c("caret", "h2o", "e1071", "mlr")
```

*Note*: I wanted to include other packages, like `tensorflow`, `randomFores`, `gbm`, etc. but for those, `pkgnet` threw an error:

> Error in data.table::data.table(node = names(igraph::V(self$pkg_graph)),  : 
  column or argument 1 is NULL 

- Next, I ran them through my function from before and assigned them each a unique name.

```{r eval=FALSE}
for (pkg in pkg_list) {
  graph <- create_pkg_graph(pkg)
  assign(paste0("graph_", pkg), graph)
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
save(graph_caret, file = "../../data/graph_caret.RData")
save(graph_h2o, file = "../../data/graph_h2o.RData")
save(graph_e1071, file = "../../data/graph_e1071.RData")
save(graph_mlr, file = "../../data/graph_mlr.RData")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
load("../../data/graph_caret.RData")
load("../../data/graph_h2o.RData")
load("../../data/graph_e1071.RData")
load("../../data/graph_mlr.RData")
```

- These individual objects I combined with [`tidygraph`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidygraph/index.html) and calculated node centrality as the number of outgoing edges.

```{r}
graph <- graph_caret %>% 
  graph_join(graph_h2o, by = "name") %>%
  graph_join(graph_e1071, by = "name") %>%
  graph_join(graph_mlr, by = "name") %>%
  mutate(color = ifelse(name %in% pkg_list, "a", "b"),
         centrality = centrality_degree(mode = "out"))
```

- Finally, I plotted the dependency network with [`ggraph`](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph):

The bigger the node labels (package names), the higher their centrality. Seems like the more basic utilitarian packages have the highest centrality (not really a surprise...).

```{r graph, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
graph %>%
  ggraph(layout = 'nicely') + 
    geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow()) + 
    geom_node_point() +
    geom_node_label(aes(label = name, fill = color, size = centrality), show.legend = FALSE, repel = TRUE) +
    theme_graph() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

- Because the complete network is a bit hard to make sense of, I plotted it again with only the packages I wanted to analyze plus dependencies that had at least 1 outgoing edge; now it is easier to see shared dependencies.

For example, `methods` and `stats` are dependencies of `caret`, `mlr` and `e1071` but not `h2o`, while `utils` is a dependency of all four.

```{r graph_subset, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
graph %>%
  filter(centrality > 1 | color == "a") %>%
  ggraph(layout = 'nicely') + 
    geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow()) + 
    geom_node_point() +
    geom_node_label(aes(label = name, fill = color, size = centrality), show.legend = FALSE, repel = TRUE) +
    theme_graph() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

It would of course be interesting to analyse a bigger network with more packages.
Maybe someone knows how to get these other packages to work with `pkgnet`?

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
