      <description>This spring, I’ll be giving talks at a couple of Meetups and conferences:

  March, 26th: At the data lounge Bremen, I’ll be talking about Explainable Machine Learning
 April, 11th: At the Data Science Meetup Bielefeld, I’ll be talking about Building Interpretable Neural Networks with Keras and LIME
  
  May, 14th: At the M3 conference in Mannheim, a colleague and I will give our workshop on building production-ready machine learning models with Keras, Luigi, DVC and TensorFlow Serving</description>

      <description>The last two days, I was in London for the M-cubed conference.
Here are the slides from my talk about Explaining complex machine learning models with LIME:
 Traditional machine learning workflows focus heavily on model training and optimization; the best model is usually chosen via performance measures like accuracy or error and we tend to assume that a model is good enough for deployment if it passes certain thresholds of these performance criteria.</description>

      <description>I’ll be giving talks and workshops at the following three upcoming conferences; hope to meet some of you there!

 From 15th to 17th October 2018, I’ll be in London for the M-cubed conference. My talk about Explaining complex machine learning models with LIME will take place on October 16   Traditional machine learning workflows focus heavily on model training and optimization; the best model is usually chosen via performance measures like accuracy or error and we tend to assume that a model is good enough for deployment if it passes certain thresholds of these performance criteria.</description>
