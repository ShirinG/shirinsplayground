      <description>As with the other videos from our codecentric.ai Bootcamp (Random Forests, Neural Nets &amp;amp; Gradient Boosting), I am again sharing an English version of the script (plus R code) for this most recent addition on How Convolutional Neural Nets work.
In this lesson, I am going to explain how computers learn to see; meaning, how do they learn to recognize images or object on images? One of the most commonly used approaches to teach computers “vision” are Convolutional Neural Nets.</description>

      <description> On November 7th, Uwe Friedrichsen and I gave our talk from the JAX conference 2018: Deep Learning - a Primer again at the W-JAX in Munich.
A few weeks before, I gave a similar talk at two events about Demystifying Big Data and Deep Learning (and how to get started).
Here are the two very similar presentations from these talks:

      <description>In my last blogpost about Random Forests I introduced the codecentric.ai Bootcamp. The next part I published was about Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Every video of our bootcamp will have example code and tasks to promote hands-on learning. While the practical parts of the bootcamp will be using Python, below you will find the English R version of this Neural Nets Practical Example, where I explain how neural nets learn and how the concepts and techniques translate to training neural nets in R with the H2O Deep Learning function.</description>

      <description>On November 7th, I’ll be in Munich for the W-JAX conference where I’ll be giving the talk that my colleague Uwe Friedrichsen and I gave at the JAX conference this April again: Deep Learning - a Primer.
Let me know if any of you here are going to be there and would like to meet up!

Slides from the original talk can be found here: https://www.slideshare.net/ShirinGlander/deep-learning-a-primer-95197733
 Deep Learning is one of the “hot” topics in the AI area – a lot of hype, a lot of inflated expectation, but also quite some impressive success stories.</description>

 Keras is a high-level open-source deep learning framework that by default works on top of TensorFlow. Keras is minimalistic, efficient and highly flexible because it works with a modular layer system to define, compile and fit neural networks. It has been written in Python but can also be used from within R.</description>

 Traditional machine learning workflows focus heavily on model training and optimization; the best model is usually chosen via performance measures like accuracy or error and we tend to assume that a model is good enough for deployment if it passes certain thresholds of these performance criteria.</description>

      <description>In our next MünsteR R-user group meetup on Tuesday, April 17th, 2018 Kai Lichtenberg will talk about deep learning with Keras. You can RSVP here: http://meetu.ps/e/DDY1B/w54bW/f
 Although neural networks have been around for quite a while now, deep learning really just took of a few years ago. It pretty much all started when Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton utterly crushed classic image recognition in the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge by implementing a deep neural network with CUDA on graphics cards.</description>

      <description>For those of you out there who speak German:
I was interviewed for a tech podcast where I talked about machine learning, neural nets, why I love R and Rstudio and how I became a Data Scientist.
You can download and listen to the podcast here: https://mies.me/2018/01/31/hmww17-machine-learning-mit-dr-shirin-glander/
  In der aktuellen Episode gibt Dr. Shirin Glander (Twitter, Homepage) uns ein paar Einblicke in das Thema Machine Learning. Wir klären zunächst, was Machine Learning ist und welche Möglichkeiten es bietet bevor wir etwas mehr in die Tiefe gehen.</description>
