Sketchnotes from TWiMLAI talk #92: Philosophy of Intelligence with Matthew Crosby
 You can listen to the podcast here.
 This week on the podcast we’re featuring a series of conversations from the NIPs conference in Long Beach, California. I attended a bunch of talks and learned a ton, organized an impromptu roundtable on Building AI Products, and met a bunch of great people, including some former TWiML Talk guests.</description>
