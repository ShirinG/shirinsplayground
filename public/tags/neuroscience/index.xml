      <description>These are my sketchnotes for Sam Charringtonâ€™s podcast This Week in Machine Learning and AI about Learning State Representations with Yael Niv: https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-92-learning-state-representations-yael-niv/
Sketchnotes from TWiMLAI talk #92: Learning State Representations with Yael Niv
 You can listen to the podcast here.
 In this interview Yael and I explore the relationship between neuroscience and machine learning. In particular, we discusses the importance of state representations in human learning, some of her experimental results in this area, and how a better understanding of representation learning can lead to insights into machine learning problems such as reinforcement and transfer learning.</description>
