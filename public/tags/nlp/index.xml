      <description>In the past, I have written and taught quite a bit about image classification with Keras (e.g. here). Text classification isn’t too different in terms of using the Keras principles to train a sequential or function model. You can even use Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) for text classification.
What is very different, however, is how to prepare raw text data for modeling. When you look at the IMDB example from the Deep Learning with R Book, you get a great explanation of how to train the model.</description>
