      <title>Ode to R</title>

      <description>Working in Data Science, I often feel like I have to justify using R over Python for most tasks. And while I do use Python for running scripts in production, I am much more comfortable with the R environment. Basically, whenever I can, I use R for prototyping, testing and teaching. But because personal gut-feeling preference isn’t a very good reason to give to (scientifically minded) people, I’ve thought a lot about the pros and cons of using R.</description>

      <title>Moving my blog to blogdown</title>

      <description>It’s been a long time coming but I finally moved my blog from Jekyll/Bootstrap on Github pages to blogdown, Hugo and Netlify! Moreover, I also now have my own domain name www.shirin-glander.de. :-)
I followed the blogdown ebook to set up my blog. I chose Thibaud Leprêtre’s tranquilpeak theme. It looks much more polished than my old blog.
My old blog will remain where it is, so that all the links that are out there will still work (and I don’t have to go through the hassle of migrating all my posts to my new site).</description>
