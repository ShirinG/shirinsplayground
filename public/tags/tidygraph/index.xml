      <description>When looking through the CRAN list of packages, I stumbled upon this little gem:
 pkgnet is an R library designed for the analysis of R libraries! The goal of the package is to build a graph representation of a package and its dependencies.
 And I thought it would be fun to play around with it. The little analysis I ended up doing was to compare dependencies of popular machine learning packages.</description>

      <description>A while back, I did an analysis of the family network of major characters from the A Song of Ice and Fire books and the Game of Thrones TV show. In that analysis I found out that House Stark (specifically Ned and Sansa) and House Lannister (especially Tyrion) are the most important family connections in Game of Thrones; they also connect many of the story lines and are central parts of the narrative.</description>
