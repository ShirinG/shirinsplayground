      <description>You can now book me and my 1-day workshop on deep learning with Keras and TensorFlow using R.
In my workshop, you will learn
 the basics of deep learning what cross-entropy and loss is about activation functions how to optimize weights and biases with backpropagation and gradient descent how to build (deep) neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow how to save and load models and model weights how to visualize models with TensorBoard how to make predictions on test data  Date and place depend on who and how many people are interested, so please contact me either directly or via the workshop page: https://www.</description>
